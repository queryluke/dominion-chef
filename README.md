_Preparing specialty Dominion card sets just for you!_

The Dominion Chef gives you more control when you generate Dominion decks. 
Can it randomly generate a card set? Sure! But it does a lot more. Want a friendly game? 
Remove all attack cards. Want a game with a lot to do each turn? Ramp up the number of action cards.
Want a low cost game? Reduce the total cost of all cards. You pick the ingredients and let the Dominion Chef do the work!
